# Web Metronome App

This is a project to create a dynamic metronome that allows users to configure a series of measures and then play the metronome. They will be able to have accounts, save pieces to our database, and allow other users to use them as well.  

## Angular development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. This is the easiest way to test against the backend. 

If the MVC application is in development, it will allow requests from localhost:4200 (this is set in the Startup.cs file).  Otherwise, you must build the Angular 4 app before MVC is built for production.

## Angular Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
